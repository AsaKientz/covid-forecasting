Galvanize DSI Capstone around forecasting COVID-19 infection rates

---
## Motivation

A

---
## Background


---
## Assumptions
- Each geographic region is self-contained (i.e., infections only come from existing sources within and not from travel, immigration, etc.)
- Testing is widespread enough to catch nearly all the infections in the population. 
- Single initial infection point per geographic area
- SIR model assumes immunity upon recovery

## Time Series Processing

### Weekly <|trend|>

7-day cyclic behavior seen


## SIR Model Overview
 - A compartmental model used to model infectious diseases.

The CDC defines low incidence as 10 or fewer new cases per 100,000 people over a period of 14 days. This rate is equivalent to 0.71 new cases per 100,000 people per day, or about 2,300 new cases per day in the United States.
